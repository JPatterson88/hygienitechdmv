                        One out of every four people suffer from some type of allergy and the numbers are increasing all of the time.  We all live indoors and it is a fact that indoor pollution is often more dangerous than outdoor pollution. The Hygienitech eco-friendly, dry, chemical free process will <span class="primary">eliminate</span> allergens from carpets, mattresses, upholstered items and just about any type of surface that people come in contact with every day.

                        Since it is a dry process, any item that Hygienitech services can be used immediately after the service is performed.  Allergy sufferers need more than air purifiers, they need Hygienitech services to sanitize the things that they come in contact with every day. Air purifiers are not effective in sanitizing the things we come in contact with every day, especially the mattresses that we all sleep on.

                    <p>How many times have you or a family member awakened from a night's sleep with itchy skin or red and irritated eyes? or how about a stuffed up nose, sneezes, wheezing or tight chest, a recurring painful head or sinus ache, a general feeling of fatigue all no particular reason? The culprit may well be the millions of dust mites that have made a home for themselves in mattresses and upholstered items and they are feeding on the skin flakes everyone sheds every night.  Thats right! Millions of microscopic dust mites that have been medically proven to trigger a whole host of allergic reactions, including asthma, bronchitis, a variety of breathing and skin problems and more.  Besides dust mites, there could be other harmful contaminants lurking in your bed, pillows, furniture, and items around the home. 
<br>
                        Remember: It doesn't matter how often sheets are changed or even if someone has attempted vacuuming the mattress, there could be millions of dust mites along with other harmful bacteria and contaminants deeply embedded below the surface. Mattresses should be cleaned every 4-6 months.</p>

                            As our country start to reopen its doors to schools, office buildings  and businesses, we are still urged to conduct ourselves in a cautious matter to help reduce the spread of Covid-19 and its developing variants. Hygienitech systems are here to help. By now, we all know how Covid, the flu, and other airborne illnesses are transmitted. The droplets linger in the air (then inhaled) for hours then settle on any and every exposed surface: keyboards, computers, desk, office chairs, and supplies. It then becomes extremely easy for the virus to travel around the office and even home with the workers. A Hygienitech Specialist can come in and properly clean and sanitize any infected surface stopping the spread of disease dead in its tracks.
